0.2.1 (2010-05-19)
==================

* Package modified to comply with repository policy (license, etc.).

* Use own template dir for layout module in order not to provoke
  (erraneous) warnings of template registry.

0.2 (2010-03-06)
================

* A minor CSS glitch has been corrected.

* The messaging system is now registered via
  ``grokcore.message``. ``grokui.base`` is no longer bound to
  ``z3c.flashmessage``.

* Dependencies have been cleaned up : ``grokui.base`` no longer
  depends on ``zope.app.zcml`` and can now be used outside the
  ``Grok`` suite. It uses only the `grokcore` packages.
